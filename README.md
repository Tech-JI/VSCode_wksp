**Claim: We’re not professional VS Code users (no deep research on it), and this workshop would only contain basic usage of VS Code.** Advanced VS Code usage could be learned by reading the official documents or in the workshop which will be held in the future.

## Previous Setup

We stongly recommend you clone this repo/[download release package](https://github.com/TechJI-2023/VSCode_wksp/releases) and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) in advance.

## Lecture

Everything we are going to talk about are written in `Lecture.md`.

## Latex

We won't talk too much about latex setup. if you need to write latex in VSCode, you may refer to the [repo](https://github.com/Hydraallen/Latex-vscode) we prepared previously.
