### [What is the difference between Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio IDE?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_what-is-the-difference-between-visual-studio-code-and-visual-studio-ide)

Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### Why VS Code?

- Rich language support: support hundreds of languages
- Medium size
- Medium fast
- Highly customizable
- Active extension market
- Good looking
- Native support for HTML/JS/TS
- Powerful native tools
